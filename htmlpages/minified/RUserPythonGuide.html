<p>Coding has come a long way in my field in a short amount of time. As recently as 5 years ago, most analysis was done in SAS. R was for the most advanced of analysts. Later, R began growing rapidly as the prospect of job automation took hold. Now, more Python users are coming into the fold, and the great "R vs. Python" debate has begun. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-freberg_python-is-better-than-r-activity-6752637240578600960-a36V/?trk=public_profile_like_view&originalSubdomain=ke">Click-bait hot takes</a> abound on the web. This is to be expected. Data scientists tend to be pretty opinionated.<h2>A summary of the R vs. Python Debate</h2><p>There is no shortage of posts about this topic, so I will keep it short. The Python folks argue that <a href=https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html>Python is the most popular coding language</a>. The sheer size of the community means that it will always be able to do more. R is fussy and esoteric, they say. The R side points out that R packages, especially those used in modeling, are often maintained by the top experts in their respective fields (<a href=https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html>survival analysis</a>, <a href=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781315370279/generalized-additive-models-simon-wood>Generalized Additive Models</a>, and <a href=https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiModel/index.html>Epidemiological Network models</a>, to name a few). Additionally, the <a href=https://www.jstatsoft.org/index>Journal of Statistical Software</a> is an academic publication that introduces and explains software implementations of new statistical methods, and R is the most common choice.<h2>Why the Debate Misses the Point</h2><p>The R vs. Python debate is largely counterproductive because it places the focus on the language instead of the analyst. The biggest risk to your data science career is not "choosing the wrong language", it is stubbornly choosing to work with only one language. Some of the oldest programming languages, COBOL and FORTRAN, are <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/technology/cobol-jobs.html>highly desired in the financial sector</a> precisely because they perform critical roles in the financial code base whilst being known by very few people. Speaking of FORTRAN, it is still used in both <a href=https://www.r-bloggers.com/2014/04/fortran-and-r-speed-things-up/ >R</a> and <a href=https://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Python>Python</a>. When there is an optimal and proper solution to a problem, the code tends to live forever, no matter the language. And, of course, new languages will be developed, such as <a href=https://julialang.org/ >Julia</a>. Stick to one language at your own peril.<p>I am reminded of a story from my own life. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, my wife and I got really into cycling. After consistent improvement early on, I hit a plateau. I wanted to upgrade my mountain bike for a $3,000 road bike. The road bike was perfectly engineered for the task: 11 pounds lighter with thinner tires to reduce friction. But, I soon realized something: the same gains and more were achievable if I rode my current bike more and stopped having post-ride beers on the weekends. Better yet, I would be the one who is 11 pounds lighter, not my bike. Talk about portable! So it is with data science: people often get frustrated and switch to shiny new tools instead of truly investing in their professional development. The worst part is, it tends to happen right as they were scratching the surface of a new, core concept in computer science, such as apply functions or multithreaded processing.<h2>Common Data Science Tasks in R and Python</h2><p>I will let you in on a little secret: R and Python look pretty darn similar for many data science tasks. To show you just how similar they can be, this blog post will walk through how both R and Python:<ol><li>Install and load special modules and packages developed by the community<li>Work with the filesystem and system commands<li>Connect to SQL databases and extract data<li>Basic data exploration: understand what kinds of data you have and how many records there are</ol><p>Future posts will cover other topics, such as data aggregation and/or data visualization. For some of the database tasks, I will connect to a SQL server instance I stood up on a personal cloud account. If you would like to stand up your own version, Microsoft has a tutorial <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms#deploy-to-azure-sql-database">here</a>.<h2>Modules and Packages: Install, Load, Use</h2><p>Really, there are four notable differences here:<ol><li>Python calls them "Modules", and R calls them "Packages"<li>R packages are installed in an R session while Python modules are installed from the shell<li>As long as an R package has been installed, it can be called using the pkg::function() syntax. Python modules must always be loaded before use.<li>Python modules rely heavily on classes, where R tends to use more functions.</ol><p>Let‘s speak to the last point briefly. Classes are objects with pre-defined structures, attributes, and methods. For example, the Python pandas module has a DataFrame class that has the attribute head to call the first few rows. For a pandas DataFrame called myDf, this attribute could be accessed with myDf.head(). R tends to use functions instead. In R, head is a function that can can be used on almost any object, and can be called with head(myDf). I suspect this is due to differences in philosophy: Python is a multi-purpose language that prioritizes and enforces rules to keep code organized and readable. R was built for a more specific purpose, so it prioritizes flexibility in its functions so that an analyst has the same tools for dataframes, matrices, or whatever object they happen to be working with that day. By the way, this idea of one mechanism working on multiple types is called <a href=https://bookdown.dongzhuoer.com/hadley/adv-r/s4-dispatch.html>method dispatching</a>.<h3>Python</h3><p>In Python, pip is the base package installer, but other options (like <a href=https://www.anaconda.com/ >Anaconda</a>) exist. In either case, the syntax in similar:<div class=code-toolbar><pre class=language-shell tabindex=0><code class=language-shell>$ pip <span class="token function">install</span> numpy

In short, a class is a pre-defined with a certain structure. For example, pandas Python modules tend to have lots of sub-modules and attributes. For example, urllib has many modules, but in data science the "request" module is the most commonly used. In such cases, you may want to only import the specific part of the module that you need for the task at hand.<div class=code-toolbar><pre class=language-python tabindex=0><code class=language-python><span class="token comment"># Not using "pd" for pandas causes an error</span>

The tidyverse is a bit of a special case: it is a set of packages designed to modernize base R, both for performance and to be more intuitive. So when you load the tidyverse package, you're actually loading a universe of packages (hence the name). After a package is loaded, any functions from that package can be called. R is structured a little differently than Python here. In the Python example above, we had to reference the package pandas (pd) to call the data.frame command. In R, loading the library is sufficient:<div class=code-toolbar><pre class=language-r tabindex=0><code class=language-r><span class="token comment"># Use mutate from one of the packages in the tidyverse</span>

It can be used when multiple libraries use the same function name. By default, R will choose the function that was loaded last when 2+ functions have the same name. Many times, the package author INTENDED to overwrite a base R function, so in practice function masking is not a big problem. Python handles the same problem by forcing you to always be explicit.

My advice is to focus on developing the advanced skills in whatever language they are most comfortable with. After those advanced skills are in your repertoire, converting them to a new language is just a matter of learning the new syntax. Tune in later for more comparisons of R vs. Python, and just keep coding.
